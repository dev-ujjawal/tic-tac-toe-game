## Game Logic

- Players take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 grid
- After every move, the game checks all possible winning combinations
- If a player satisfies a winning condition, the game ends and displays the winner
- If all cells are filled and no winning condition is met, the game is declared a draw
- The restart button resets the board and allows a new game to begin
